# Five machine learning steps

## Define the problem

- Step 1: Define a very specific task
- Step 2: Identify the machine learning task we might use to solve this problem

## Build a dataset

- Data collection
- Data inspection
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization

## Train a model

- Training dataset: The data on which the model will be trained. Most of your data will be here.
- Test dataset: The data withheld from the model during training, which is used to test how well your model will generalize to new data.

- Hyperparameters are settings on the model that are not changed during training but can affect how quickly or how reliably the model trains, such as the number of clusters the model should identify.
- Model parameters are settings or configurations the training algorithm can update to change how the model behaves.

- A loss function is used to codify the modelâ€™s distance from this goal.

## Evaluate the model

- An iterative process
