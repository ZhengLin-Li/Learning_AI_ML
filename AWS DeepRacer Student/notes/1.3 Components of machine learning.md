# Components of machine learning

Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:

- A machine learning model
- A model training algorithm
- A model inference algorithm

# A machine learning model

A more technical definition would be that a machine learning model is a block of code or framework that can be modified to solve different but related problems based on the data provided.

# A model training algorithm

Model training algorithms:

- Think about the changes that need to be made.
- Make those changes.
- Repeat.

# A model inference algorithm

Model inference is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.
